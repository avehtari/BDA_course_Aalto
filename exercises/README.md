**NOTE**: The assignment descriptions are still being updated and individual exercises are not guaranteed to be up to date until Monday (4am) of the hand-in period of the corresponding exercise week (see the deadlines on [mycourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=24401&section=2)).

Some exercises refer to additional files. These are located in the folder `additional_files`.

The Rnw files are TeX files that can be compiled with Sweave (in R-Studio). To change it back Tex, just remove the R chunks and Swaeve dependency (\\SweaveOpts{concordance=TRUE}) and it should compile using ordinary TeX.
