You are free to use these assignments in self study and other courses
(CC-BY-NC 4.0), but please do not publish complete answers online.

## Weekly assignments

There are 9 weekly assignments (two of them have two weeks to
submit). Assignments can be found from [assignments
folder](assignments). The deadline days for the assignments are given
in [the course schedule](Aalto2020.html#Schedule_2020).

- The assignments are introduced on Mondays.
- There are [TA sessions](#TA_sessions) for getting help. These sessions are not obligatory.
- Students return their answers to
[peergrade](https://www.peergrade.io) by the end of the week (hand-in
period). The deadlines are on Sundays 23:59. We can't accept late submissions due to the peergrading process.
- After this, each student reviews 3 random other students'
answers and provides feedback via online rubric form in peergrade during Monday to
Wednesday 23:59 (peer grading period).
- After peergrading, each student reflects on the feedback (reactions, e.g. not helpful/helpful) before Sunday 23:59.
- If a student receives inappropriate feedback/grading or reaction, they may "flag" it
for TAs to check from Wednesday to Sunday (flagging period).
Strongly conflicting feedback/gradings are also manually checked by TAs (after
flagging period). As a guideline, the TA responsible of that particular 
assignment will resolve these flags within the next week.

NOTE: The assignments instructions are still being updated and
individual assignments are not guaranteed to be up to date until Monday
(4am) of the hand-in period of the corresponding assignment week (See
the deadlines below, e.g. first exercise is not guaranteed to be up to
date until 9.9 at 8am).

Report all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in
[peergrade](https://www.peergrade.io). Submitting empty pdf or almost
empty pdf is not allowed. Include also any source code to the report
(either in appendix or embedded in the answer). By anonymity it is meant
that the report should not contain your name or student number. In
addition to the correctness of the answers, the overall quality and
clearness of the report is also evaluated.

The assignments are mostly solved using computer (R or Python). Related
demos for each assignment are available in the course web pages (links
in Materials section). See [TA sessions](#TA_sessions) for getting help.

For those who are self studying or who miss several assignment hand-ins
for a good reason, there is possibility to hand-in all assignments once
in January.

## Peergrade

Register to peergrade with your Aalto-email so that we can connect your
peergrade scores to a correct person. The class code needed for
registration will be posted to the students before the course starts.

## Assignment scoring

Points are given from both submitting an assignment and giving
feedback. Submission performance gives 70\% and feedback performance
gives 30\% of the total score. Only the student's who returned
assignment are allowed to give feedback to others.

In peergrade, the resulting grade is formed by comparing one's
performance to the others. Thus, one should not worry about getting
100\% score. A critical reviewer will also affect other students'
grading. In addition, a question can always be flagged for course
personnel to check.

We have noticed in previous years that some students return an empty
pdf to peergrade to still get points from giving feedback. This is not
allowed. If a student returns an empty pdf or it is obvious from the
pdf that the student hasn't done any effort for the assignment, the
student is not allowed to give feedback. The course staff will monitor
returned assignments, and negative points will be awarded to empty assignments.
If any student is reviewing an empty pdf, please contact course staff.

### Submission score

After peer grading is over for an assignment, each submission receives a
"Submission score". This score is between 0\% and 100\% depending on how
well the peers evaluated the submission.

The numerical score for each criteria is normalised to be between 0\%
and 100\%, where 0\% is given for the worst possible answer, and 100\%
for the best possible answer. As an example, in a Scale-question with 5
levels, the different answers will count 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 100\%.

The total submission score is calculated for a submission by averaging
the scores from each of the peers. The score from an individual peer
evaluating a submission is obtained by averaging over the criteria in
the feedback rubric.

Within each assignment, there are two sections "Basic requirements" and
"Overall quality of the report". These segments are weighted so that
they each provide 7.5\% of that assignment's total score. The remaining
85\% is distributed evenly to the rest of the sections. Within each
section, the points are distributed evenly among each question.

If a student has flagged part of their received evaluations and a TA has
accepted the flag and overruled the original evaluation, then TA's new
evaluation is used for computing the score instead. If a teacher
overrules a specific answer by one student, that answer is taken to be
the correct one for that question on that submission. This means that
the other student answers on that question are disregarded in the final
score of the submission.

There are 9 assignment rounds in total. Each round has different
weighting when computing the total score. 

### Feedback score

The feedback score depends on the reactions, such that a student's
feedback score on an assignment is an average of the reactions
received. If no reactions have been given to the student's reviews, no
feedback score is computed and it will simply show as "-".

The following definitely are reasons to react positively to feedback:

- Reviewer giving you tips on how to improve the report/answer.
- Reviewer making the effort of finding and pointing out where your bug originates from.

### Bonus points

In addition to the peergrade score, one can get bonus points from
Slack activity and by answering a time usage questionnaire in the course page in mycourses.
Slack activity and the questionnaire will not count for maximum assignment
score.

Other students' Slack activity will not affect one's resulting
grade, i.e. there is no need to try to perform in the Slack or to take
any part in it at all.

After each assignment, a voluntary anonymous questionnaire is opened on [the course page in mycourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=28239) for the peergrading feedback period - Monday to Wednesday 23:59.

## Be polite

Remember to be polite when peergrading, giving feedback and reacting to
feedback. Do not spend a lot of time fighting over the grading of one question
from one student. If you don't agree you can submit a flag or in extreme case
contact the TAs. Also, keep in mind that in most of the cases, which
we've seen, the students have been fighting for points which have less
than 1/1000 effect on the final score. Long fight over that is not
worth it.  If you get feedback which makes you angry, breath and wait a
moment before unleashing your anger back. We ask you to honor the
system and be polite to your peers.

## TA sessions

You can get help for making assignments by asking in Slack from other
students or in weekly TA sessions by asking TAs. The sessions are
voluntary and one may come and go as pleases during the
sessions. 

There are three TA sessions each week; please see [the course
schedule](Aalto2020.html#Schedule_2020) for more details on the meeting
times. In the TA sessions, you can get one-to-one help with your
assignments and project work.

You can get help in the following forms:

- Written communication on *Slack*: you will chat with a TA using the “direct messages” feature on *Slack*. You can also e.g. share code snippets through Slack direct messages if it helps.
- Oral communication on Zoom: you will chat with a TA using a video conference on Zoom. You can also use e.g. screen sharing on Zoom if it helps.

We will use channel **#queue** in Slack to coordinate everything. We announce there when the exercise session starts. Then you will write a help request there, describing in sufficient detail exactly what is the problem with which you would need help (see below).

Once a TA is free and your question is the first request in the queue, a TA will mark it with a check mark reaction. Then the TA will contact you and help with your problem. Finally, once the problem is solved, the TA who helped you will delete your request from the queue.

### Getting help via Slack

- Go to the Slack channel #queue.
- Write a help request (see below), starting with the keyword “Slack”.
- A TA will send you a direct message on Slack.
- You will discuss through direct messages until your problem is solved, and then the TA will close the discussion and delete your help request.

Please do not send direct messages to TAs without going through the above protocol. If you have follow-up questions later, please put a new request to the queue.

### Getting help via Zoom

- Follow these instructions to install Zoom and to sign in to Zoom.
- Open Zoom, and make sure your video and audio are configured correctly. Create a new Zoom conference call, and copy the meeting URL.
- Go to the Slack channel #queue.
- Write a help request (see below), starting with the keyword “Zoom”, and end it with the Zoom meeting URL.
- A TA will click on the meeting URL to join the Zoom conference that you created.
- You will get help until your problem is solved, and then the TA will close the call and delete your help request.

### What to write in the help request?

Your help request should contain a concise summary of exactly what kind of help you would need. Ideally, after reading the help request and looking at your current solution in your GitHub repository, a TA should be able to already have an answer for you.

Try to describe what is the problem, what you have tried, what you already know, and exactly what is the relevant part of the code. Please highlight the important parts. Here are some fictional examples of good help requests:

*Slack: TODO: add BDA course specific example*

*Zoom: TODO: add BDA course specific example*
