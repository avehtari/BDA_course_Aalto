\subsubsection*{General information}


\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item The recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{\textbf{here}} and R-Studio \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{\textbf{here}}. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from \href{https://education.rstudio.com/}{\textbf{RStudio Education pages}}.
\item Instead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see \href{https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/FAQ.html#How_to_use_R_and_RStudio_remotely}{\textbf{how to use R and RStudio remotely}}.
\item When working with R, we recommend writing the report using R markdown and the provided \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/master/templates/assignment_template.rmd}{\textbf{R markdown template}}. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.
\item Instead of R markdown, you can use other software to make the pdf report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used. These instructions are available also in \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/master/templates/assignment_template.pdf}{\textbf{the PDF produced from the R markdown template}}.
\item  Report all results in a single, {\bf anonymous} *.pdf -file and return it to \href{peergrade.io}{\textbf{peergrade.io}}.
\item The course has its own R package \texttt{aaltobda} with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade="never" skips question about updating other packages):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{install.packages("remotes")}
\item \texttt{remotes::install\_github("avehtari/BDA\_course\_Aalto", \\ subdir = "rpackage", upgrade="never")}
\end{enumerate}
\item Many of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package \\ \texttt{markmyassignment}. Information on how to install and use the package can be found \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/markmyassignment/vignettes/markmyassignment.html}{\textbf{here}}. There is no need to include \texttt{markmyassignment} results in the report.
\item Recommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.
\item We collect common questions regarding installation and technical problems in a course Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). This can be found \href{https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/blob/master/FAQ.md}{\textbf{here}}.
\item Deadline for all assignments are \textbf{Sunday at 23.59}.
\item If you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository! Useful feedback will be thanked with bonus points.
