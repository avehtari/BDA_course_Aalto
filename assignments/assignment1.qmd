# General information


The exercises of this assignment are meant to test whether or not you have sufficient knowledge
to participate in the course. The first question checks that you
remember basic terms of probability calculus. The second exercise checks
your basic computer skills and guides you to learn some R functions. In
the last three ones you will first write the math for solving the
problems (you can, for example, write the equations in markdown or
include a photo of hand written answers), and then implement the final
equations in R (and then you can use `markmyassignment` to check your
results). The last question checks that you have found the course book.

**The maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.**

We prepared a quarto template specific to this assignment to help you get started. You can inspect this and future templates

* as a [qmd file](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/assignments/template1.qmd),
* as a [rendered html file](template1.html)
* or as a [rendered pdf file](template1.pdf)

or you can download all template `qmd` files and some additional files at [templates.zip](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/assignments/templates.zip) (also available on Aalto JupyterHub under `/coursedata`).

# Basic probability theory notation and terms

This can be trivial or you may need to refresh your memory on these concepts (see, e.g. Aalto course *First Course in Probability and
Statistics*). Explain each of the following terms with one sentence:

-   probability
-   probability mass (function)
-   probability density (function)
-   probability distribution
-   discrete probability distribution
-   continuous probability distribution
-   cumulative distribution function (cdf)
-   likelihood





::: {.rubric}


* How is the answer?
    - Totally wrong/has not tried
    - Something sensible written
    - All/almost all are correct (>=70% correct)

# Basic computer skills


This task deals with elementary plotting
and computing skills needed during the rest of the course. You can
use either R or Python, although R is the recommended language in this course and
we will only guarantee support in R. For documentation in R, just
type `?{function name here}`.




::: {.subtask letter=a}
Plot the density function of the Beta-distribution, with mean
$\mu = 0.2$ and variance $\sigma^2=0.01$. The parameters
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the Beta-distribution are related to the
mean and variance according to the following equations
$$\begin{aligned}
    \alpha = \mu \left( \frac{\mu(1-\mu)}{\sigma^2} - 1 \right), \quad
    \beta = \frac{\alpha (1-\mu) }{\mu} \,.\end{aligned}$$

:::







::: {.subtask letter=b}
Take a sample of 1000 random numbers from the above distribution
and plot a histogram of the results. Compare visually to the
density function.
:::





::: {.subtask letter=c}

Compute the sample mean and variance from the drawn sample.
Verify that they match (roughly) to the true mean and variance
of the distribution.

:::





::: {.subtask letter=d}
Estimate the central 95% probability interval of the distribution from the drawn sample.
:::






::: {.rubric}

* Is the source code for the solutions included?
* Does the plot in a) look something like this: **...**
* Does the plot in b) look something like this: **...**
* Is the computed mean in c) close to **...**?
* Is the variance in c) close to **...**?
* Is the probability interval in d) roughly **...**? Remember that since the interval is computed from random sample, there can be small variation, but the answers should be roughly the same!

:::

::: {.help}
## Further formatting recommendations

* Please try to include as much code and output as needed, but as little as possible.
* Please make sure that the plots are properly labeled and are easily legible and understandable. This means
    * they should have x- and y-labels,
    * the text within should be of a size comparable to the size of the surrounding text and
    * each plot should have a concise but descriptive caption or title.
* Please make sure to report a sensible number of digits when reporting numbers. You will get more precise instructions later on, but for now think independently about how many digits of your results are important for the assignment.

# Bayes' theorem 1

A group of researchers has designed a new
inexpensive and painless test for detecting lung cancer. The test is
intended to be an initial screening test for the population in
general. A positive result (presence of lung cancer) from the test
would be followed up immediately with medication, surgery or more
extensive and expensive test. The researchers know from their
studies the following facts:

-   Test gives a positive result in $98\%$ of the time when the test
    subject has lung cancer.
-   Test gives a negative result in $96\%$ of the time when the
    test subject does not have lung cancer.
-   In general population approximately one person in 1000 has lung
    cancer.

::: {.subtask letter=a}

The researchers are happy with these preliminary results (about
$97\%$ success rate), and wish to get the test to market as soon as
possible. How would you advise them? Base your answer on Bayes' rule
computations.

:::

::: {.hint}
Relatively high false negative (cancer doesn't get
detected) or high false positive (unnecessarily administer
medication) rates are typically bad and undesirable in tests.
:::




Here are some probability values that can help you figure
out if you copied the right conditional probabilities from the
question.

-   P(Test gives positive \| Subject does not have lung cancer) =
    $4\%$
-   P(Test gives positive **and** Subject has lung cancer) =
    $0.098\%$ this is also referred to as the **joint probability**
    of *test being positive* and the *subject having lung cancer*.




::: {.rubric}

* Is p(has cancer|test result is positive) computed using Bayes' formula
(or its complement p(does not have cancer|test result is positive))?
* Is the result p(has cancer|test result is positive)=**...** (or p(does not have cancer|test result
is positive)=**...**)
* Is the result motivated with something like **...**

# Bayes' theorem 2

We have three boxes, A, B, and C. There are

-   2 red balls and 5 white balls in the box A,
-   4 red balls and 1 white ball in the box B, and
-   1 red ball and 3 white balls in the box C.

Consider a random experiment in which one of the boxes is randomly
selected and from that box, one ball is randomly picked up. After
observing the color of the ball it is replaced in the box it came
from. Suppose also that on average box A is selected 40% of the time
and box B $10\%$ of the time (i.e. $P(A) = 0.4$).



::: {.subtask letter=a}
What is the probability of picking a red ball?
Implement an R function to compute that probability.

::: {.subtask letter=b}
If a red ball was picked, from which box did it most probably come from?

# Bayes' theorem 3

Assume that on average fraternal twins (two
fertilized eggs and then could be of different sex) occur once in
150 births and identical twins (single egg divides into two separate
embryos, so both have the same sex) once in 400 births (**Note!**
This is not the true value, see Exercise 1.6, page 28, in BDA3).
American male singer-actor Elvis Presley (1935 -- 1977) had a twin
brother who died in birth. Assume that an equal number of boys and
girls are born on average.

::: {.subtask letter=a}
What is the probability that Elvis was an
identical twin? Show the steps how you derived the equations to
compute that probability and implement a function in R that computes the probability.
