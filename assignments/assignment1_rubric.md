- No answer
- Probability rules ... and ... used, but the result is not ...
- Probability rules ... and ... used, and the result is ...

### Q15 - 1 point

b) How is the answer for what box is most probable?

-   No answer 

-   Bayes rule used to compute probabilities for all boxes given that the picked ball is red, but the answers are not p(A\|R)≈0.358, p(B\|R)≈0.251 and p(C\|R)≈0.391. (or non scaled results for A: 0.114, B:0.08, C:0.125) )

-   Bayes rule used to compute probabilities for all boxes given that the picked ball is red, the answers are p(A\|R)≈0.358, p(B\|R)≈0.251 and p(C\|R)≈0.391 and it is **not** explicitly said that the most probable box is box C. (or non scaled results for A: 0.114, B:0.08, C:0.125, and it is **not** said that this is biggest for C)

-   Bayes rule used to compute probabilities for all boxes given that the picked ball is red, the answers are p(A\|R)≈0.358, p(B\|R)≈0.251 and p(C\|R)≈0.391 and it is explicitly said that the most probable box is box C. (or non scaled results for A: 0.114, B:0.08, C:0.125, and it is said that this is biggest for C)

## S7 - 7.5 points

Overall quality of the report

### Q17 -

Does the report follow the formatting instructions?

- Not at all
- Little
- Mostly
- Yes

### Q18 -

In case the report doesn't fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.

### Q19 -

Please provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code.
