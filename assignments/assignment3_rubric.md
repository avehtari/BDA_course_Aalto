Exercise 1

### Q3 - 1 point

Is the source code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q4 - 1 point

Are the likelihood, prior and the posterior for computing the average hardness value reported (it is also ok to refer to the book)?

- No
- Yes, but some are missing
- Yes

### Q5 - 1 point

For a)-part, were the point estimates and posterior interval provided? (The posterior mean should be close to ... and 95% posterior interval should be around [...,...])


- No
- Yes, but seem incorrect or only one estimate was reported
- Yes, and the reported values seem plausible

### Q6 - 1 point

For a)-part, was the density plotted?

- No
- Yes, but seem incorrect
- Yes, and the plot seems plausible

### Q7 - 1 point

For b)-part, was a formula or a simulation method presented for computing the posterior predictive distribution (it is also ok to refer to the book)?

- No
- Yes, but seems incorrect
- Yes

### Q8 - 1 point

For b)-part, were the point estimate and predictive interval provided? (95% predictive interval should be around [...,...] and the mean the same as in a)-part).

- No
- Yes, but seems incorrect
- Yes, and the reported values seem plausible

### Q9 - 1 point

For b)-part, was the density plotted?

- No
- Yes, but seems incorrect
- Yes, and the plot seem plausible

## S3 - 28.3 points

Exercise 2

### Q10 - 1 point

Is the source code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q11 - 1 point

Are the likelihood, prior and the posterior for the death probabilities reported (it is also ok to refer to the book)?

- No
- Yes, but some are missing
- Yes

### Q12 - 1 point

Was the simulation algorithm in a)-part for computing the posterior for the odds ratio presented or implemented?

- No
- Yes, but seems incorrect
- Yes

### Q13 - 1 point

In a)-part, was the odds ratio summarized with point estimate and posterior interval? (The mean should be something like ... and 95% posterior interval [..., ...])

- No
- Yes, but results seem incorrect
- Yes, and the results seem plausible

### Q14 - 1 point

Were some discussion about testing some alternative priors provided?

- Not at all
- Some analysis was provided but it was lacking or did not make sense

Is the source code included?

- No
- Yes

### Q16 - 1 point

Are the likelihood, prior and the posterior for the windshield hardness values reported? (It is also ok to refer to the book or related formulas from exercise 1)

- No
- Yes, but some are missing
- Yes

### Q17 - 1 point

Was the simulation algorithm in a)-part for computing the difference in the means presented or implemented?

- No
- Yes, but seems to be incorrect
- Yes

### Q18 - 1 point

In a)-part, was the posterior for the difference between the means in a)-part summarized with point and interval estimates? (The mean should be close to ... and 95% posterior interval [..., ...] or something close to it)

- No answer
- Yes, but results seem incorrect or only one estimate was given
- Yes, and results seem reasonable
