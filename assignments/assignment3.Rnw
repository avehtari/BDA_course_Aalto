\subsection*{1. Inference for normal mean and deviation (3 points)}

A factory has a production line for manufacturing car windshields.
A sample of windshields has been taken for testing hardness. The
observed hardness values $\mathbf{y}_1$ can be found in file
{\tt windshieldy1.txt}. The data
can also be accessed from the {\tt aaltobda} R package as follows:

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>=
library(aaltobda)
data("windshieldy1")
head(windshieldy1)
@

We may assume that the observations follow a normal distribution with an unknown standard deviation $\sigma$. We wish to obtain information about the unknown average hardness $\mu$. Here it is not necessary to derive the posterior distribution as it has already been done in the book.

Below are test examples that can be used. The functions below can also be tested with \texttt{markmyassignment}. \textbf{Note!} This is \emph{only} a test case. You need to change to the full data {\tt windshieldy} above when reporting your results.

<<echo=TRUE>>=
windshieldy_test <- c(13.357, 14.928, 14.896, 14.820)
@

% See exercises/solution folder in teacher repo
<<echo=FALSE>>=
mu_point_est <- function(data) 14.5
mu_interval <- function(data, prob) c(13.3, 15.7)
mu_pred_point_est <- function(data) 14.5
mu_pred_interval <- function(data, prob) c(11.8, 17.2)
@

In the report, formulate (1) model likelihood, (2) the prior, and (3) the resulting posterior.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item What can you say about the unknown $\mu$? Summarize your results using Bayesian point estimate (i.e. $E(\mu|y)$), a posterior interval (95\%), and plot the density. A test example can be found below for an uninformative prior. \textbf{Note!} Posterior intervals are also called credible intervals and are different from confidence intervals.
<<echo=TRUE>>=
mu_point_est(data = windshieldy_test)
mu_interval(data = windshieldy_test, prob = 0.95)
@
\item What can you say about the hardness of the next windshield
  coming from the production line before actually measuring the
  hardness? Summarize your results using Bayesian point estimate, a \emph{predictive} interval (95\%), and plot the density.  A test example can be found below.
<<echo=TRUE>>=
mu_pred_point_est(data = windshieldy_test)
mu_pred_interval(data = windshieldy_test, prob = 0.95)
@
\textbf{Note!} Predictive intervals are different from posterior intervals.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Hint} With a conjugate prior a closed form posterior is Student's $t$ form (see equations in the book).
R users can use the {\tt dt} function after doing input normalisation. We have added an R function {\tt dtnew()} in the {\tt aaltobda} R package which does that. For generating samples, you can use the corresponding {\tt rtnew} function.


\subsection*{2. Inference for the difference between proportions (3 points)}

% See exercises/solution folder in teacher repo
<<echo=FALSE>>=
posterior_odds_ratio_point_est <- function(p0, p1) 2.676
posterior_odds_ratio_interval <- function(p0, p1, prob) c(0.875, 6.059)
@

An experiment was performed to estimate the effect of beta-blockers
on mortality of cardiac patients. A group of patients was randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups: out of 674 patients
receiving the control, 39 died, and out of 680 receiving the
treatment, 22 died. Assume that the outcomes are independent and
binomially distributed, with probabilities of death of $p_0$ and $p_1$
under the control and treatment, respectively. Set up a noninformative
or weakly informative prior distribution on $(p_0,p_1)$.

In the report, formulate (1) model likelihood, (2) the prior, and (3) the resulting posterior.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Summarize the posterior distribution for the odds ratio, $(p_1/(1-p_1))/(p_0/(1-p_0))$. Compute the point estimate, a posterior interval (95\%), and plot the histogram. Use \href{http://www.fharrell.com/2017/10/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statements.html}{Frank Harrell's recommendations} how to state results in Bayesian two group comparison. Below is a test case on how the odd ratio should be computed. \textbf{Note!} This is \emph{only} a test case. You need to change to the real posteriors when reporting your results.
<<echo=TRUE>>=
set.seed(4711)
p0 <- rbeta(100000, 5, 95)
p1 <- rbeta(100000, 10, 90)

posterior_odds_ratio_point_est(p0 = p0, p1 = p1)
posterior_odds_ratio_interval(p0 = p0, p1 = p1, prob = 0.9)
@
\item Discuss the sensitivity of your inference
to your choice of prior density with a couple of sentences.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Hint} With a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior is the Beta form for each group separately (see equations in the book). You can use {\tt rbeta()} to sample from the posterior distributions of $p_0$ and $p_1$, and use these samples and odds ratio equation to get samples from the distribution of the odds ratio.

\subsection*{3. Inference for the difference between normal means (3 points)}

Consider a case where the same factory has two production lines for
manufacturing car windshields. Independent samples from the two
production lines were tested for hardness. The hardness measurements
for the two samples $\mathbf{y}_1$ and $\mathbf{y}_2$ are given in the files {\tt windshieldy1.txt} and {\tt windshieldy2.txt}. These can be accessed directly with

<<echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE>>=
data("windshieldy1")
data("windshieldy2")
@

We assume that the samples have unknown standard deviations $\sigma_1$
and $\sigma_2$.

In the report, formulate (1) model likelihood, (2) the prior, and (3) the resulting posterior.

Use uninformative or weakly informative priors and answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item What can you say about $\mu_d = \mu_1 - \mu_2$? Summarize your
  results using a Bayesian point estimate, a posterior interval (95\%), and plot
  the histogram. Use
  \href{http://www.fharrell.com/2017/10/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statements.html}{Frank
    Harrell's recommendations} how to state results in Bayesian two
  group comparison.
\item What is the probability that the means are the same? Explain
  your reasoning with a couple of sentences.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Hint} With a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior is Student's $t$ form for each group separately (see equations in the book). You can use {\tt rt()} function to sample from the posterior distributions of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, and use these samples to get samples from the distribution of the difference $\mu_d = \mu_1 - \mu_2$. The equivalent function in R is the {\tt rt} function. Be careful to scale them and shift them according to their mean and variance values in R, as described above.

\textbf{Hint} Posterior distributions of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are continuous, and thus the posterior distribution of the difference $\mu_d = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ is also continuous. What is the probability that $\mu_d = 0$?
