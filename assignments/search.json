    "text": "In addition to R-markdown, Quarto can be used to write the assignment reports. This template contains essentially the same information as the old R-markdown template but we illustrate how you can use Quarto for the assignments.\nSome useful resources to get started with Quarto (also an example of a list):\n\nGetting started with Quarto and Rstudio from the official webpage\nA comprehensive user guide from the official webpage\nMarkdown basics\nQuarto FAQ for R-markdown users\nAwesome Quarto - list by Mickaël Canouil\n\nTo create your assignment, you can use the assignment-specific templates (recommended, see e.g. the links at the top of assignment 1) or remove the formatting instructions and use this file as a template. Keep the header (the first lines of this file between two lines of —) as it sets the author name to be anonymous, and you can set the title to match the assignment number.\nAs with R-markdown, you can use the text editor of your choice, but RStudio’s editor is probably the easiest and you can choose the formatting (e.g. section headings, bolding, lists, figures, etc.) from the toolbar. Switching between the source and visual mode allows the quick preview of your formatting.\nNote The report should be anonymous and submitted to peergrade.io as assignmentX.pdf. Aalto JupyterHub has everything installed and you should be able to render the templates to pdf without any further set-up, but if there are problems contact the TAs or get more information on this from the Quarto documentation. Alternatively, if you have problem with creating a PDF file, start by creating an HTML file and the just print the HTML to a PDF. You may also use other software to create the report PDF, but follow the general instructions in this file (see the pdf version of the template file).",

This assignment is meant to test whether or not you have sufficient knowledge to participate in the course. The first question checks that you remember basic terms of probability calculus. The second exercise checks you recognise the most important notation used throughout the course and used in BDA3. The third-fifth exercise you will solve some basic Bayes theorem questions to check your understanding on the basics of probability theory. The 6th exercise checks on whether you recall the three steps of Bayesian Data Ananlysis as mentioned in chapter 1 of BDA3. The last exercise walks you through an example of how we can use models to generate distributions for outcomes of interest, applied to a setting of a simplified Roulette table.\nThis quarto document is not intended to be submitted, but to render the questions as they appear on Mycourses to be available also outside of it.
