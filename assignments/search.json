You may find an additional discussion about choosing priors in a blog post by Andrew Gelman.\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.\nWe prepared a quarto template to help you get started.\n\n\nReading instructions:\nChapter 1 and 2 in BDA3, see the reading instructions for Chapter 1 and the reading instructions for Chapter 2.\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade.\nAll grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R here and R-Studio here. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the soon to be provided template. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used..\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and return it to peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package\nmarkmyassignment. Information on how to install and use the package can be found here. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in peergrade. You can set email alerts for trhe deadlines in peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet. You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations. Do not share your answers publicly. Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year. All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs or almost empty PDFs as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or almost empty submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Inference for binomial proportion\nAlgae status is monitored in 274 sites at Finnish lakes and rivers. The observations for the 2008 algae status at each site are presented in the dataset algae in the aaltobda package (‘0’: no algae, ‘1’: algae present).\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be the probability of a monitoring site having detectable blue-green algae levels and \\(y\\) the observations in algae. Use a binomial model for the observations \\(y\\) and a \\(\\BetaDist(2,10)\\) prior for binomial model parameter \\(\\pi\\) to formulate a Bayesian model. Here it is not necessary to derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\pi\\) as it has already been done in the book and it suffices to refer to that derivation. Also, it is not necessary to write out the distributions; it is sufficient to use label-parameter format, e.g. \\(\\BetaDist(\\alpha,\\beta)\\).\nYour task is to perform Bayesian inference for a binomial model and answer questions based on it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulate\n\nthe likelihood \\(p(y|\\pi)\\) as a function of \\(\\pi\\),\nthe prior \\(p(\\pi)\\), and\nthe resulting posterior \\(p(\\pi|y)\\).\n\nReport the posterior in the format \\(\\BetaDist(\\alpha,\\beta)\\), where you replace \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) with the correct numerical values.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nWith a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior has Beta form (see equations in the book and in the slides).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about the value of the unknown \\(\\pi\\) according to the observations and your prior knowledge? Summarize your results with a point estimate (i.e. \\(E(\\pi|y)\\)) and a 90% posterior interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nPosterior intervals are also called credible intervals and are different from confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the proportion of monitoring sites with detectable algae levels \\(\\pi\\) is smaller than \\(\\pi_0=0.2\\) that is known from historical records?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.d)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat assumptions are required in order to use this kind of a model with this type of data?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nNo need to discuss exchangeability yet, as it is discussed in more detail in BDA Chapter 5 and Lecture 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.e)\n\n\n\n\n\nMake prior sensitivity analysis by testing a couple of different reasonable priors and plot the different posteriors. Summarize the results by one or two sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Inference for binomial proportion - 85/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nIs source code included?\nQ4: \nAre the prior, likelihood and posterior forms in a) reported (derivation of posterior not necessary)?\n\nNo\nSome missing\nYes\n\nQ5: \nIs the reported resulting posterior correct …?\n\nIt is not reported, that the posterior distribution is a … distribution.\nIt is reported, that the posterior distribution is …, but the numerical values for the parameters are incorrect\nIt is reported, that the posterior distribution is …, and the numerical values for the parameters are correct.\n\nQ6: \nIn part b), is there at least one point estimate reported. Sample based estimates are also ok. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong due to a wrong posterior distribution being used. With the right posterior, mean, median, and mode are all approximately ….\nQ7: \nFor the b) part, is the 90% posterior interval reported? Sample based estimate is also ok. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong in the first place. If the posterior was right, the 90% posterior interval is roughly ….\nQ8: \nFor the c) part, is the posterior probability Pr(π&lt;0.2|y) reported? Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong. If the posterior was right, the result should be approximately ….\nQ9: \nFor the d) part, does the report discuss …\n\nNo\nNo, but other reasonable assumptions are discussed\nYes, but not quite right or some missing\nYes\n\nQ10: \nFor the e) part, is there some comparison and discussion of results obtained with alternative prior parameters?\n\nNo\nYes, but the results and conclusions are clearly wrong\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S3: Overall quality of the report - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ11: \nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nQ12: \nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ13: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code."

    "text": "1 General information\nThis assignment is related to Chapters 2 and 3. Use Frank Harrell’s recommendations on how to state results in Bayesian two group comparisons (and note that there is no point null hypothesis testing in this assignment).\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 9.\nWe have prepared two quarto templates to help you get started:\n\nA recommended template which uses some additional packages, which however requires a bit more set-up work to run and\na simple template which doesn’t use those additional packages and is therefore easier to get to run.\n\n\n\nReading instructions:\nChapter 2 and 3 in BDA3, see the reading instructions for Chapter 2 and the reading instructions for Chapter 3.\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade.\nAll grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R here and R-Studio here. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the soon to be provided template. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used..\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and return it to peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package\nmarkmyassignment. Information on how to install and use the package can be found here. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in peergrade. You can set email alerts for trhe deadlines in peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet. You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations. Do not share your answers publicly. Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year. All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs or almost empty PDFs as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or almost empty submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Inference for normal mean and deviation (3 points)\nA factory has a production line for manufacturing car windshields. A sample of windshields has been taken for testing hardness. The observed hardness values \\(\\mathbf{y}_1\\) can be found in the dataset windshieldy1 in the aaltobda package.\nWe may assume that the observations follow a normal distribution with an unknown standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). We wish to obtain information about the unknown average hardness \\(\\mu\\). For simplicity we assume standard uninformative prior discussed in the book, that is, \\(p(\\mu, \\sigma) \\propto \\sigma^{-1}\\). It is not necessary to derive the posterior distribution in the report, as it has already been done in the book (see section 3.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulate\n\nthe likelihood,\nthe prior, and\nthe resulting posterior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about the unknown \\(\\mu\\)?

A group of patients was randomly assigned to treatment and control groups: out of 674 patients receiving the control, 39 died, and out of 680 receiving the treatment, 22 died. Assume that the outcomes are independent and binomially distributed, with probabilities of death of \\(p_0\\) and \\(p_1\\) under the control and treatment, respectively. Set up a noninformative or weakly informative prior distribution on \\((p_0,p_1)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulate\n\nthe likelihood,\nthe prior, and\nthe resulting posterior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarize the posterior distribution for the odds ratio, \\[\n\\mathrm{OR} = (p_1/(1-p_1))/(p_0/(1-p_0)).\n\\] Compute\n\nthe point estimate \\(E(\\mathrm{OR}|y_0,y_1)\\),\na posterior 95%-interval, and\nplot the histogram.\n\nUse Frank Harrell’s recommendations how to state results in Bayesian two group comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\nWith a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior is the Beta form for each group separately (see equations in the book). You can use rbeta() to sample from the posterior distributions of \\(p_0\\) and \\(p_1\\), and use these samples and odds ratio equation to get samples from the distribution of the odds ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nUse at least two different priors, and discuss the sensitivity of your inference to your choice of prior density with a couple of sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S3: Inference for the difference between proportions (3 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ10: \nIs the source code included?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ11: \nAre the likelihood, prior and the posterior for the death probabilities reported?

(The mean should be close to … and 95% posterior interval approximately …)\n\nNo\nYes, but results seem incorrect\nYes, and the results seem plausible\n\nQ14: \nIn part b), was some discussion about testing alternative priors provided? (For example, one could have repeated the computations in a)-part which a couple of alternative priors and reported these results or some related general conclusions briefly)\n\nNot at all\nSome analysis was provided but it was lacking or did not make sense\nSome alternative priors were tested and some sensible discussion provided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Inference for the difference between normal means (3 points)\nConsider a case where the same factory has two production lines for manufacturing car windshields. Independent samples from the two production lines were tested for hardness. The hardness measurements for the two samples \\(\\mathbf{y}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}_2\\) be found in the datasets windshieldy1 and windshieldy2 in the aaltobda package.\nWe assume that the samples have unknown standard deviations \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\).

You can use the rtnew() function to sample from the posterior distributions of \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\), and use these samples to get samples from the distribution of the difference \\(\\mu_d = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 4.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this specific model, what is the probability that the means are exactly the same (\\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\))?

If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ22: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code."

    "text": "1 General information\nThis assignment is related to Chapters 10 and 11.\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 6.\nWe have prepared a quarto template to help you get started.\nWe recommend you use the docker container.\n\n\nReading instructions: Chapter 10 and 11 in BDA3, see the reading instructions for Chapter 10 and the reading instructions for Chapter 11.\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade.\nAll grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting accuracy\n\n\n\nFor posterior statistics of interest, only report digits for which the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) is zero.\nExample: If you estimate \\(E(\\mu)=1.234\\) with MCSE(\\(E(\\mu)\\)) = 0.01, you should report \\(E(\\mu)=1.2\\).\nSee lecture video 4.1, the chapter notes, and a case study for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R here and R-Studio here. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the soon to be provided template. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used..\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and return it to peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package\nmarkmyassignment. Information on how to install and use the package can be found here. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in peergrade. You can set email alerts for trhe deadlines in peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet. You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations. Do not share your answers publicly. Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year. All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs or almost empty PDFs as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or almost empty submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Generalized linear model: Bioassay model with Metropolis\nMetropolis algorithm: Replicate the computations for the bioassay example of section 3.7 in BDA3 using the Metropolis algorithm. The Metropolis algorithm is described in BDA3 Chapter 11.2. More information on the bioassay data can be found in Section 3.7 in BDA3, and in Chapter 3 notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement the Metropolis algorithm as an R function for the bioassay data. Use the Gaussian prior as in Assignment 4, that is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\alpha \\\\ \\beta\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\sim\n    \\text{N} \\left( \\mu_0,  \\Sigma_0 \\right), \\qquad\n    \\text{where} \\quad\n     \\mu_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n     \\Sigma_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2^2 & 12 \\\\ 12 & 10^2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nCompute with log-densities. Reasons are explained on page 261 of BDA3 and lecture video 4.1. Remember that \\(p_1/p_0=\\exp(\\log(p_1)-\\log(p_0))\\). For your convenience we have provided functions that will evaluate the log-likelihood for given \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (see bioassaylp() in the aaltobda package). Notice that you still need to add the prior yourself and remember the unnormalized log posterior is simply the sum of log-likelihood and log-prior. For evaluating the log of the Gaussian prior you can use the function dmvnorm from package aaltobda.\nUse a simple (normal) proposal distribution. Example proposals are \\(\\alpha^* \\sim N(\\alpha_{t-1}, \\sigma = 1)\\) and \\(\\beta^* \\sim N(\\beta_{t-1}, \\sigma = 5)\\). There is no need to try to find optimal proposal but test some different values for the jump scale (\\(\\sigma\\)). Remember to report the one you used. Efficient proposals are dicussed in BDA3 p. 295–297 (not part of the course). In real-life a pre-run could be made with an automatic adaptive control to adapt the proposal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude in the report the following:\n\nDescribe in your own words in one paragraph the basic idea of the Metropolis algorithm (see BDA3 Section 11.2, and lecture video 5.1).\nThe proposal distribution (related to jumping rule) you used. Describe briefly in words how you chose the final proposal distribution you used for the reported results.\nThe initial points of your Metropolis chains (or the explicit mechanism for generating them).\nReport the chain length or the number of iterations for each chain. Run the simulations long enough for approximate convergence (see BDA Section 11.4, and lecture 5.2).\nReport the warm-up length (see BDA Section 11.4, and lecture 5.2).\nThe number of Metropolis chains used. It is important that multiple Metropolis chains are run for evaluating convergence (see BDA Section 11.4, and lecture 5.2).\nPlot all chains for \\(\\alpha\\) in a single line-plot. Overlapping the chains in this way helps in visually assessing whether chains have converged or not.\nDo the same for \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn complex scenarios, visual assessment is not sufficient and \\(\\widehat{R}\\) is a more robust indicator of convergence of the Markov chains. Use \\(\\widehat{R}\\) for convergence analysis. You can either use Eq. (11.4) in BDA3 or the more recent version described in a recent article. You should specify which \\(\\widehat{R}\\) you used. In R the best choice is to use function rhat_basic() from the package posterior. Remember to remove the warm-up samples before computing \\(\\widehat{R}\\). Report the \\(\\widehat{R}\\) values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) separately. Report the values for the proposal distribution you finally used.\n\n) Describe briefly in your own words the basic idea of \\(\\widehat{R}\\) and how to to interpret the obtained \\(\\widehat{R}\\) values.\n) Tell whether you obtained good \\(\\widehat{R}\\) with first try, or whether you needed to run more iterations or how did you modify the proposal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the draws for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (scatter plot) and include this plot in your report. You can compare the results to Figure 3.3b in BDA3 to verify that your code gives sensible results. Notice though that the results in Figure 3.3b are generated from posterior with a uniform prior, so even when if your algorithm works perfectly, the results will look slightly different (although fairly similar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Generalized linear model: Bioassay model with Metropolis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nIs the implementation of density_ratio function included ?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ4: \nIs the implementation of metropolis_bioassay function included ?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ5: \n2 a) Is the brief description of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm included (and it’s not complete nonsense)?

If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ20: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code."

By default, it prints as the mean and standard deviation of the samples, such that rvar(p0) prints as 0.05 ± 0.021 and rvar(p1) prints as 0.1 ± 0.029.\nThe datatype is “designed to […] be able to be used inside data.frame()s and tibble()s, and to be used with distribution visualizations in the ggdist package.” The code below sets up an R data.frame() with the samples in p0 and p1 wrapped in an rvar, and uses that data frame to visualize the samples using ggdist, an R package building on ggplot2 and “designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization”.\nThe below plot, Figure 3 uses ggdist’s stat_dotsinterval(), which by default visualizes\n\nan rvar’s median and central 66% and 95% intervals using a black dot and lines of varying thicknesses as when using ggdist’s stat_pointinterval() and\nan rvar’s samples using grey dots as when using ggdist’s stat_dots():\n\n\nr0 = rvar(p0)\nr1 = rvar(p1)\nggplot(data.frame(\n    rv_name=c(\"control\", \"treatment\"), rv=c(r0, r1)\n)) +\n    aes(xdist=rv, y=rv_name) + \n    labs(x=\"probabilities of death\", y=\"patient group\") + \n    stat_dotsinterval()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Probabilities of death for the two patient groups.\n\n\n\n\nrvars make it easy to compute functions of random variables, such as\n\ndifferences, e.g. \\(p_0 - p_1\\): r0 - r1 computes an rvar which prints as -0.05 ± 0.037, indicating the sample mean and the sample standard deviation of the difference of the probabilities of death,\nproducts, e.g. \\(p_0 \\, p_1\\): r0 * r1 computes an rvar which prints as 0.005 ± 0.0026 which in this case has no great interpretation, or\nthe odds ratios needed in task 3.b).\n\nBelow, in Figure 4, we compute the odds ratios using the rvars and visualize its median, central intervals and samples, as above in Figure 3:\n\nrodds_ratio = (r1/(1-r1))/(r0/(1-r0))\nggplot(data.frame(\n    rv=c(rodds_ratio)\n)) +\n    aes(xdist=rv) + \n    labs(x=\"odds ratio\", y=\"relative amount of samples\") + \n    stat_dotsinterval()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Odds ratios of the two patient groups.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Figure 4 to visually check whether the answers you computed for 3.b) make sense.\nThis block showcases advanced tools, which you will be allowed and expected to use after this assignment.

    "text": "1 General information\nThis assignment is related to Chapters 3 and 10.\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 6.\nWe have prepared a quarto template to help you get started.\n\n\nReading instructions:\nChapters 3 and 10 in BDA3, see the reading instructions for Chapter 3 and the reading instructions for Chapter 10.\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade.\nAll grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting accuracy\n\n\n\nFor posterior statistics of interest, only report digits for which the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) is zero.\nExample: If you estimate \\(E(\\mu)=1.234\\) with MCSE(\\(E(\\mu)\\)) = 0.01, you should report \\(E(\\mu)=1.2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R here and R-Studio here. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the soon to be provided template. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used..\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and return it to peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package\nmarkmyassignment. Information on how to install and use the package can be found here. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in peergrade. You can set email alerts for trhe deadlines in peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet. You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations. Do not share your answers publicly. Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year. All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs or almost empty PDFs as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or almost empty submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Bioassay model\nIn this exercise, you will use a dose-response relation model that is used in Section 3.7 of the course book and in the chapter reading instructions. The used likelihood is the same, but instead of uniform priors, we will use a bivariate normal distribution as the joint prior distribution of the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\nIn the prior distribution for \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\), the marginal distributions are \\(\\alpha \\sim N(0,2^2)\\) and \\(\\beta \\sim N(10,10^2)\\), and the correlation between them is \\(\\mathrm{corr}(\\alpha, \\beta)=0.6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nReport the mean (vector of two values) and covariance (two by two matrix) of the bivariate normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nThe mean and covariance of the bivariate normal distribution are a length–\\(2\\) vector and a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix. The elements of the covariance matrix can be computed using the relation of correlation and covariance.\nYou are given 4000 independent draws from the posterior distribution of the model in the dataset bioassay_posterior in the aaltobda package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\nthe mean as well as\n5 \\(\\%\\) and 95 \\(\\%\\) quantiles separately\n\nfor both\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\).\n\nReport also the Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSEs) for the mean and quantile estimates and explain in words what does Monte Carlo standard error mean and how you decided the number of digits to show.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe answer is graded as correct only if the number of digits reported is correct! The number of significant digits can be different for the mean and quantile estimates. In some other cases, the number of digits reported can be less than MCSE allows for practical reasons.\nHint:\nQuantiles can be computed with the quantile function. With \\(S\\) draws, the MCSE for \\(\\text{E}[\\theta]\\) is \\(\\sqrt{\\text{Var} [\\theta]/S}\\). MCSE for the quantile estimates can be computed with the mcse_quantile function from the aaltobda package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Bioassay model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nAre the mean and covariance of the prior in a) reported? The correct answers are …:\n\nNot reported\nYes, but they are not correct\nYes, and they are correct\n\nQ4: \nAre the means and their MCSEs of alpha and beta in b) reported? Note that the number of digits reported for the means must follow the rule given in the assignment. The correct answers are alpha: mean … and beta: mean ….\n\nNot reported\nYes, but one or both means are incorrect\nYes, and the means are correct\n\nQ5: \nAre the quantiles and their MCSEs of alpha and beta in b) reported? Note that the number of digits reported for the quantiles must follow the rule given in the assignment. The correct answers are alpha: 5% quantile …, 95% quantile … and beta: 5% quantile …, 95% quantile ….\n\nNot reported\nYes, but one or more quantiles are incorrect\nYes, and the quantiles are correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Importance sampling\nNow we discard our posterior draws and switch to importance sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a function for computing the log importance ratios (log importance weights) when the importance sampling target distribution is the posterior distribution, and the proposal distribution is the prior distribution from a). Explain in words why it’s better to compute log ratios instead of ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nNon-log importance ratios are given by equation (10.3) in the course book. The fact that our proposal distribution is the same as the prior distribution makes this task easier. The logarithm of the likelihood can be computed with the bioassaylp function from the aaltobda package. The data required for the likelihood can be loaded with data(\"bioassay\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.d)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a function for computing normalized importance ratios from the unnormalized log ratios in c). In other words, exponentiate the log ratios and scale them such that they sum to one. Explain in words what is the effect of exponentiating and scaling so that sum is one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.e)\n\n\n\n\n\nSample 4000 draws of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) from the prior distribution from a). Compute and plot a histogram of the 4000 normalized importance ratios. Use the functions you implemented in c) and d).\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nUse the function rmvnorm from the aaltobda package for sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.f)\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the importance ratios, compute the importance sampling effective sample size \\(S_{\\text{eff}}\\) and report it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nEquation (10.4) in the course book.\nNote:\nBDA3 1st (2013) and 2nd (2014) printing have an error for \\(\\tilde{w}(\\theta^s)\\) used in the effective sample size equation (10.4). The normalized weights equation should not have the multiplier S (the normalized weights should sum to one). Errata for the book http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/errata_bda3.txt. The later printings, the online version, and the slides have the correct equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.g)\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain in your own words what the importance sampling effective sample size represents. Also explain how the effective sample size is seen in the histogram of the weights that you plotted in e).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.h)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a function for computing the posterior mean using importance sampling, and compute the mean using your 4000 draws. Explain in your own words the computation for importance sampling. Report the means for alpha and beta, and also the Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSEs) for the mean estimates. Report the number of digits for the means based on the MCSEs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe values below are only a test case, you need to use 4000 draws for alpha and beta in the final report.\nHint:\nUse the same equation for the MCSE of \\(\\text{E}[\\theta]\\) as earlier (\\(\\sqrt{\\text{Var} [\\theta]/S}\\)), but now replace \\(S\\) with \\(S_{\\text{eff}}\\). To compute \\(\\text{Var} [\\theta]\\) with importance sampling, use the identity \\(\\text{Var}[\\theta] = \\text{E}[\\theta^2] - \\text{E}[\\theta]^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S3: Importance sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ6: \nIs the source code for the function in c) reported?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ7: \nIs the source code for the function in d) reported?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ8: \nDoes the histogram in e) look something like this figure? If it is evident that the normalized importance ratios are computed correctly, but the prior was incorrect, you can still grade “Reported and looks similar”.\n\nNot reported\nReported, but looks different\nReported and looks similar\n\nQ9: \nIs the effective sample size in f) reported? The correct range for the effective sample size is between …. However, if it is evident that the effective sample size is computed correctly, but the prior was incorrect, you can still grade “Yes, and it is correct”.\n\nNo\nYes, but it is not correct\nYes, and it is correct\n\nQ10: \nThe correct explanation for g) is roughly the following: …\nQ11: \nWhat is the connection between S_eff and the histogram of weights: … How is the answer?\n\nTotally wrong/has not tried\nSomething is a bit wrong\nExplanation is sensible\n\nQ12: \nIs the source code for the function in h) reported?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ13: \nAre the means and their MCSEs of alpha and beta in h) reported? Note that the number of digits reported for the means must follow the rule given in the assignment. The correct answers should be close to these: alpha: mean … and beta: mean …\n\nNot reported\nYes, but they are incorrect\nYes, and they are correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S4: Overall quality of the report - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ14: \nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nQ15: \nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ16: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code."

    "text": "1 General information\nThe exercises of this assignment are not necessarily related to Chapter 1, but rather work to test whether or not you have sufficient knowledge to participate in the course. The first question checks that you remember basic terms of probability calculus. The second exercise checks your basic computer skills and guides you to learn some R functions. In the last three ones you will first write the math for solving the problems (you can, for example, write the equations in markdown or scan and include hand written answers), and then implement the final equations in R (and then you can use markmyassignment to check your results).\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.\nWe prepared a quarto template to help you get started.\n\n\nReading instructions:\nChapter 1 in BDA3, see the reading instructions.\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade.\nAll grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R here and R-Studio here. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the soon to be provided template. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used..\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and return it to peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package\nmarkmyassignment. Information on how to install and use the package can be found here. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in peergrade. You can set email alerts for trhe deadlines in peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet. You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations. Do not share your answers publicly. Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year. All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs or almost empty PDFs as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or almost empty submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Basic probability theory notation and terms\nThis can be trivial or you may need to refresh your memory on these concepts (see, e.g. Aalto course First Course in Probability and Statistics). Explain each of the following terms with one sentence:\n\nprobability\nprobability mass (function)\nprobability density (function)\nprobability distribution\ndiscrete probability distribution\n\ncontinuous probability distribution\n\ncumulative distribution function (cdf)\n\nlikelihood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Basic probability theory notation and terms - 17/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nHow is the answer?\n\nTotally wrong/has not tried\nSomething sensible written\n\nAll/almost all are correct (&gt;=70% correct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Basic computer skills\nThis task deals with elementary plotting and computing skills needed during the rest of the course.

The test is intended to be an initial screening test for the population in general. A positive result (presence of lung cancer) from the test would be followed up immediately with medication, surgery or more extensive and expensive test. The researchers know from their studies the following facts:\n\nTest gives a positive result in 98\\(\\%\\) of the time when the test subject has lung cancer.\nTest gives a negative result in 96 \\(\\%\\) of the time when the test subject does not have lung cancer.\nIn general population approximately one person in 1000 has lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers are happy with these preliminary results (about 97\\(\\%\\) success rate), and wish to get the test to market as soon as possible. How would you advise them? Base your answer on Bayes’ rule computations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nRelatively high false negative (cancer doesn’t get detected) or high false positive (unnecessarily administer medication) rates are typically bad and undesirable in tests.\nHere are some probability values that can help you figure out if you copied the right conditional probabilities from the question.\n\nP(Test gives positive | Subject does not have lung cancer) = 4\\(\\%\\)\nP(Test gives positive and Subject has lung cancer) = 0.098\\(\\%\\) this is also referred to as the joint probability of test being positive and the subject having lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S4: Bayes’ theorem 1 - 17/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ10: \nIs p(has cancer|test result is positive) computed using Bayes’ formula (or its complement p(does not have cancer|test result is positive))?\nQ11: \nIs the result p(has cancer|test result is positive)=… (or p(does not have cancer|test result is positive)=…)\nQ12: \nIs the result motivated with something like …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Bayes’ theorem 2\nWe have three boxes, A, B, and C.

This is not the true value, see Exercise 1.6, page 28, in BDA3). American male singer-actor Elvis Presley (1935 – 1977) had a twin brother who died in birth.

Show the steps how you derived the equations to compute that probability and implement a function in R that computes the probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S6: Bayes’ theorem 3 - 17/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ16: \nHow is the answer for probability of Elvis having had an identical twin brother?\n\nNo answer\nProbability that Elvis had an identical twin brother is computed using Bayes rule, but the result is not roughly …\nProbability that Elvis had an identical twin brother is computed using Bayes rule, and the result is roughly …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S7: Overall quality of the report - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ17: \nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nQ18: \nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ19: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code."

    "text": "See https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/:\n\nDocker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.\nYou can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. Refer to the following section and choose the best installation path for you.\n\nFurther instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux.\nWith Linux things should be self-explanatory enough for the users that self-select to use Linux. For Mac installation instructions should be easy to follow, but do tell if they are not. For Windows, things might get a bit more complicated, but it should be less painful than trying to get Stan to work.\n\n\nIt looks like you’d ideally enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in its second version, see https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Sharing-files-with-host-machine:\n\nFor better performance, it is recommended to set up a Linux distribution on WSL2 and save your files in the Linux file system. See the best practices of Docker Desktop WSL2 backend for details. https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#best-practices\n\nInstruction on how to install it can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install:\n\n\nDevelopers can access the power of both Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.\n\nYou must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below. If you are on earlier versions please see the manual install page.\n\nYou can now install everything you need to run WSL with a single command. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting “Run as administrator”, enter the wsl –install command, then restart your machine.\nwsl --install\nThis command will enable the features necessary to run WSL and install the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. (This default distribution can be changed).\nIf you’re running an older build, or just prefer not to use the install command and would like step-by-step directions, see WSL manual installation steps for older versions.\nThe first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you’ll be asked to wait for files to de-compress and be stored on your machine. All future launches should take less than a second."
