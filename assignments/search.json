    "text": "In addition to R-markdown, Quarto can be used to write the assignment reports. This template contains essentially the same information as the old R-markdown template but we illustrate how you can use Quarto for the assignments.\nSome useful resources to get started with Quarto (also an example of a list):\n\nGetting started with Quarto and Rstudio from the official webpage\nA comprehensive user guide from the official webpage\nMarkdown basics\nQuarto FAQ for R-markdown users\nAwesome Quarto - list by Mickaël Canouil\n\nTo create your assignment, you can use the assignment-specific templates (recommended, see e.g. the links at the top of assignment 1) or remove the formatting instructions and use this file as a template. Keep the header (the first lines of this file between two lines of —) as it sets the author name to be anonymous, and you can set the title to match the assignment number.\nAs with R-markdown, you can use the text editor of your choice, but RStudio’s editor is probably the easiest and you can choose the formatting (e.g. section headings, bolding, lists, figures, etc.) from the toolbar. Switching between the source and visual mode allows the quick preview of your formatting.\nNote The report should be anonymous and submitted to peergrade.io as assignmentX.pdf. Aalto JupyterHub has everything installed and you should be able to render the templates to pdf without any further set-up, but if there are problems contact the TAs or get more information on this from the Quarto documentation. Alternatively, if you have problem with creating a PDF file, start by creating an HTML file and the just print the HTML to a PDF. You may also use other software to create the report PDF, but follow the general instructions in this file (see the pdf version of the template file).",

These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in MyCourses.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following installs the aaltobda package:\n#| cache: true\n# Caching should be fine here\ninstall.packages(\"aaltobda\", repos = c(\"https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Inference for binomial proportion\nAlgae status is monitored in 274 sites at Finnish lakes and rivers.

You can inspect this and future templates\n\nas a qmd file,\nas a rendered html file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Instructions for Answering the Assignment Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions below are exact copies of the text found in the MyCourses quiz and should serve as a notebook where you can store notes and code.\nWe recommend opening these notebooks in the Aalto JupyterHub, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nFor inspiration for code, have a look at the BDA R Demos and the specific Assignment code notebooks\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in MyCourses.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor convenience the assignment questions are copied below.

You may find an additional discussion about choosing priors in a blog post by Andrew Gelman.\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.\nWe prepared a quarto template specific to this assignment (html, qmd, pdf) to help you get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nReading instructions:\n\nThe reading instructions for BDA3 Chapter 1.\nThe reading instructions for BDA3 Chapter 2.\n\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade. All grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE RStudio).\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nIf you want to install R and RStudio locally, download R and RStudio.\nThere are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and RStudio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the provided template. The template includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used.\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. The package is pre-installed in JupyterHub. To install the package on your own system, run the following code (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"aaltobda\", repos = c(\"https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package markmyassignment (pre-installed in JupyterHub). Information on how to install and use the package can be found in the markmyassignment documentation. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in Peergrade. You can set email alerts for the deadlines in Peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nYou can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs, almost empty PDFs, copy of the questions, nonsense generated by yourself or AI, as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or nonsense submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric\n\n\n\n\nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank nor nonsense? If the pdf is blank, nonsense, or something like only a copy of the questions, 1) report it as problematic in Peergrade-interface to get another report to review, and 2) send a message to TAs.\nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the template for assignment 2. You can download the qmd-file or copy the code from this rendered document after clicking on &lt;/&gt; Code in the top right corner.\nPlease replace the instructions in this template by your own text, explaining what you are doing in each exercise.\nThe following will set-up markmyassignment to check your functions at the end of the notebook:\nlibrary(markmyassignment)\nassignment_path = paste(\"https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/\",\n\"blob/master/tests/assignment2.yml\", sep=\"\")\nset_assignment(assignment_path)\nThe following installs the aaltobda package:\n#| cache: true\n# Caching should be fine here\ninstall.packages(\"aaltobda\", repos = c(\"https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Inference for binomial proportion\nAlgae status is monitored in 274 sites at Finnish lakes and rivers. The observations for the 2008 algae status at each site are presented in the dataset algae in the aaltobda package (‘0’: no algae, ‘1’: algae present).\nLoading the library and the data.\n\nlibrary(aaltobda)\ndata(\"algae\")\n# The data are now stored in the variable `algae`.\n# These are the values for the prior required in the assignment\nprior_alpha = 2\nprior_beta = 10\n\nThe below data is only for the tests, you need to change to the full data algae when reporting your results.\nalgae_test &lt;- c(0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be the probability of a monitoring site having detectable blue-green algae levels and \\(y\\) the observations in algae. Use a binomial model for the observations \\(y\\) and a \\(Beta(2,10)\\) prior for binomial model parameter \\(\\pi\\) to formulate a Bayesian model. Here it is not necessary to derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\pi\\) as it has already been done in the book and it suffices to refer to that derivation. Also, it is not necessary to write out the distributions; it is sufficient to use label-parameter format, e.g. \\(Beta(\\alpha,\\beta)\\).\nYour task is to perform Bayesian inference for a binomial model and answer questions based on it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\nFormulate\n\nthe likelihood \\(p(y|\\pi)\\) as a function of \\(\\pi\\),\nthe prior \\(p(\\pi)\\), and\nthe resulting posterior \\(p(\\pi|y)\\).\n\nReport the posterior in the format \\(Beta(\\alpha,\\beta)\\), where you replace \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) with the correct numerical values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior has Beta form (see equations in BDA3 and in the slides).\n\n\n\nWrite the likelihood, the prior and the posterior here!\n\n# These are not the actual values for the posterior!\n# You will have to compute those from the data!\nposterior_alpha = 2\nposterior_beta = 10\n\nYou can do string interpolation using R inline code execution in quarto as such:\n\\(\\alpha_\\text{prior}\\) is 2 and \\(\\beta_\\text{prior}\\) is 10. Or string interpolation within math: \\(Beta(2,10)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about the value of the unknown \\(\\pi\\) according to the observations and your prior knowledge? Summarize your results with a point estimate (i.e. \\(E(\\pi|y)\\)) and a 90% posterior interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior intervals are also called credible intervals and are different from confidence intervals.\n\n\n\nKeep the below name and format for the functions to work with markmyassignment:\n# Useful function: qbeta()\n\nbeta_point_est &lt;- function(prior_alpha, prior_beta, data) {\n    # Do computation here, and return as below.\n    # This is the correct return value for the test data provided above,\n    # combined with the prior provided above.\n    0.2222222\n}\nbeta_interval &lt;- function(prior_alpha, prior_beta, data, prob=0.9) {\n    # Do computation here, and return as below.\n    # This is the correct return value for the test data provided above,\n    # combined with the prior provided above.\n    c(0.0846451, 0.3956414)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the proportion of monitoring sites with detectable algae levels \\(\\pi\\) is smaller than \\(\\pi_0=0.2\\) that is known from historical records?\n\n\nKeep the below name and format for the function to work with markmyassignment:\n# Useful function: pbeta()\n\nbeta_low &lt;- function(prior_alpha, prior_beta, data, pi_0=0.2) {\n    # Do computation here, and return as below.\n    # This is the correct return value for the test data provided above,\n    # combined with the correct prior.\n    0.4511238\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.d)\n\n\n\nWhat assumptions are required in order to use this kind of a model with this type of data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nNo need to discuss exchangeability yet, as it is discussed in more detail in BDA3 Chapter 5 and Lecture 7.\n\n\n\nWrite your answer here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.e)\n\n\n\nMake prior sensitivity analysis by testing a couple of different reasonable priors and plot the different posteriors. Summarize the results by one or two sentences.\n\n\nPlot the PDFs here. Explain shortly what you do.\n# Useful function: dbeta()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric\n\n\n\n\nIs source code included?\nAre the prior, likelihood and posterior forms in a) reported (derivation of posterior not necessary)?\n\nNo\nSome missing\nYes\n\nIs the reported resulting posterior correct ?\n\nIt is not reported, that the posterior distribution is a distribution.\nIt is reported, that the posterior distribution is , but the numerical values for the parameters are incorrect\nIt is reported, that the posterior distribution is , and the numerical values for the parameters are correct.\n\nIn part b), is there at least one point estimate reported. Sample based estimates are also OK. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong due to a wrong posterior distribution being used. With the right posterior, mean, median, and mode are all approximately .\nFor the b) part, is the 90% posterior interval reported? Sample based estimate is also OK. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong in the first place. If the posterior was right, the 90% posterior interval is roughly .\nFor the c) part, is the posterior probability Pr(π&lt;0.2|y) reported? Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong. If the posterior was right, the result should be approximately .\nFor the d) part, does the report discuss\n\nNo\nNo, but other reasonable assumptions are discussed\nYes, but not quite right or some missing\nYes\n\nFor the e) part, is there some comparison and discussion of results obtained with alternative prior parameters?\n\nNo\nYes, but the results and conclusions are clearly wrong\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarkmyassignment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following will check the functions for which markmyassignment has been set up:\nmark_my_assignment()\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric\n\n\n\n\nDoes the report include comment on whether AI was used, and if AI was used, explanation on how it was used?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the general and formatting instructions, specify the instructions that have not been followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference is visible. This will help the other student to improve their reports so that they are easier to read and review. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nPlease also provide feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation, other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty and non-nonsense reports. If you think the report is perfect, and you can’t come up with any suggestions how to improve, you can provide feedback on what you liked and why you think some part of the report is better than yours.",
