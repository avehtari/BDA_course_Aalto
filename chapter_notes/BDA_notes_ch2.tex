\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}

  \begin{list}{-}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}
  \item in this course the normal distribution with known mean but
    unknwon variance is the most important
  \item glance through Poisson and exponential
  \end{list}
\item 2.7 glance through this example, which illustrates benefits of prior information, no need to read all the details (it's quite long example)
\item 2.8 Noninformative and weakly informative priors
\end{list}

Laplace's approach for approximating integrals is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 4.\\

\subsection*{Integration over Beta distribution}

Chapter 2 has an example of analysing the ratio of girls born in Paris
1745--1770.  Laplace used binomial model and uniform prior which
produces Beta distribution as posterior distribution. Laplace wanted
to calculate $p(\theta \geq 0.5)$, which is obtained as
\begin{eqnarray*}
  p(\theta \geq 0.5) &=& \int_{0.5}^1  p(\mathbf{\theta}|y,n,M) d\theta \\
  &=& \frac{493473!}{241945!251527!} \int_{0.5}^1 \theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y} d\theta
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$.
%
Integral has a form which is called \emph{incomplete Beta function}.
Bayes and Laplace had difficulties in computing this, but nowadays
there are several series and continued fraction expressions.
%
% For example, betacdf function in Matlab first tries a continued
% fraction expression and if it diverges, then an alternative
% approximation.
Furthermore usually the normalisation term is computed by computing
$\log(\Gamma(\cdot))$ directly without explicitly computing
$\Gamma(\cdot)$.
%
Bayes was able to solve integral given small $n$ and $y$.
%
In case of large $n$ and $y$, Laplace used Gaussian approximation of
the posterior (more in chapter 4).
%
In this specific case, R pbeta gives the same results as Laplace's
result with at least 3 digit accuracy.

\subsection*{Numerical accuracy}

Laplace calculated
\begin{equation*}
  p(\theta \geq 0.5 | y, n, M) \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-42}.
\end{equation*}
Correspondingly Laplace could have calculated
\begin{equation*}
  p(\theta \geq 0.5 | y, n, M) = 1 - p(\theta \leq 0.5 | y, n, M),
\end{equation*}
which in theory could be computed in R with
{\tt 1-pbeta(0.5,y+1,n-y+1)}.  In practice this fails, due to the
limitation in the floating point representation used by the computers.
In R the largest floating point number which is smaller than 1 is
about 1-eps/4, where eps is about $2.22 \times 10^{-16}$ (the smallest
floating point number larger than 1 is 1+eps). Thus the result from
{\tt pbeta(0.5,y+1,n-y+1)} will be rounded to 1 and $1-1=0\neq 1.15
\times 10^{-42}$. We can compute $p(\theta \geq 0.5 | y, n, M)$ in R with {\tt pbeta(0.5, y+1, n-y+1, lower.tail=FALSE)}.

\subsection*{Highest Posterior Density interval}

HPD interval is not invariant to reparametrization. Here's an illustrative
example (using R and package {\tt HDInterval}):
 {\small
\begin{verbatim}
> r <- exp(rnorm(1000))
> quantile(log(r),c(.05, .95))
       5%       95% 
-1.532931  1.655137 
> log(quantile(r,c(.05, .95)))
       5%       95% 
-1.532925  1.655139 
> hdi(log(r), credMass = 0.9)
    lower     upper 
-1.449125  1.739169 
attr(,"credMass")
[1] 0.9
> log(hdi(r, credMass = 0.9))
    lower     upper 
-2.607574  1.318569 
attr(,"credMass")
[1] 0.9
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection*{Gaussian distribution in more complex models and methods}

Gaussian distribution is commonly used in mixture models, hierarchical
models, hierarchical prior structures, scale mixture distributions,
Gaussian latent variable models, Gaussian processes, Gaussian random
Markov fields, Kalman filters, proposal distribution in Monte Carlo
methods, etc.

\subsection*{Predictive distribution}

Often the predictive distribution is more interesting than the
posterior distribution. The posterior distribution describes the
uncertainty in the parameters (like the proportion of red chips in the
bag), but the predictive distribution describes also the uncertainty
about the future event (like which color is picked next). This
difference is important, for example, if we want to what could happen
if some treatment is given to a patient.

In case of Gaussian distribution with known variance $\sigma^2$ the model is
\begin{align*}
  y\sim \N(\theta,\sigma^2),
\end{align*}
where $\sigma^2$ describes aleatoric uncertainty.
Using uniform prior the posterior is 
\begin{align*}
  p(\theta|y) \sim \N(\theta|\bar{y},\sigma^2/n),
\end{align*}
where $\sigma^2/n$ described epistemic uncertainty related to $\theta$.
Using uniform prior the posterior predictive distribution is 
\begin{align*}
  p(\tilde{y}|y) \sim \N(\theta|\bar{y},\sigma^2+\sigma^2/n),
\end{align*}
where the uncertainty is sum of epistemic ($\sigma^2/n$) and aleatoric
uncertainty ($\sigma^2$).

\subsection*{Weakly informative priors}

Our thinking has advanced since section 2.9 was written. See the Prior
Choice Wiki
(\url{https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations}
for more recent general discussion and model specific recommendations.
