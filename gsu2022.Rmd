Bayesian Data Analysis Global South (GSU) 2022

Lecturer: [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/index.html)

1. Max 300 students with priority for global south and other underrepresented groups (GSU).
1. From 19th February (first assignment deadline 27th February to 14th May .
1. All the material (textbook, videos, assignments, extra reading
   material) are freely available (see below) so you can also
   self-study in your own pace.
1. The course is free (no cost) and possible to organize with help of volunteer TAs.
1. This BDA course instance is aimed to support learning with peer
   support. By following the videos and doing assignments at the same
   time with others, you can discuss the material in assignments in
   the course slack, there is peer-grading platform to get feedback
   about your assignment solutions, and voluntary TAs help answering
   questions. As everything is volunteer based we can't guarantee
   quick responses, but at least you will get something more than when
   studying only by yourself.
1. This course is not the easiest Bayesian course available in
   internet, but it can be your first Bayesian course if your
   mathematical and programming skills are sufficient. See the
   prerequisites below. For easier material to start with see the end
   of Prerequisites section below.
1. You will not get a formal certificate for passing the course from
   Aalto University. 
1. The communication happens in the course slack, please don't email
   the lecturer or TAs. The slack link has been emailed to the accepted students.

All the course material is available in a [git repo](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto) and via these pages are for easier navigation. All the material can be used in other courses. Text and videos licensed under CC-BY-NC 4.0. Code licensed under BSD-3.

## Registration

YOu can apply for the course by filling [a registration form](). The registration form asks several pre-requisites questions, and filling the form takes some time.

## TA Registration

We have some volunteer TAs already, but a a few more would be great.
All TAs will get a personal certificate from the lecturer Aki Vehtari
if they actively participate helping students, answering questions,
and possibly organize some TA sessions. We assume to have enough TAs
that no-one needs to take part every week of the course and you can
drop out if other obligations require so. The lecturer will support
TAs.

To register as volunteer TA fill in your information (email, country,
prerequisites check, a brief comment on justification why you think
you can be a TA)  [here]().

[The electronic version of the course book
Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd ed, by by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal
Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) is available for non-commercial purposes. Hard copies are available from [the publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Bayesian-Data-Analysis/Gelman-Carlin-Stern-Dunson-Vehtari-Rubin/p/book/9781439840955) and many book stores.
See also [home page for the
book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), [errata for the
book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/errata_bda3.txt), and [chapter notes](chapter_notes/BDA_notes.pdf).

## Prerequisites

 - Basic terms of probability theory
     - probability, probability density, distribution
     - sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule
     - expectation, mean, variance, median
     - in English, see e.g. Wikipedia and [Introduction to probability and statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/)
 - Some algebra and calculus
 - Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
     - histogram, density plot, scatter plot
     - see e.g. [BDA R demos](demos.html#BDA_R_demos)
     - see e.g. [BDA Python demos](demos.html#BDA_Python_demos)

This course has been designed so that there is strong emphasis in
computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest
computational tools.

If you find BDA3 too difficult to start with, I recommend

 - For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and causal analysis see [Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, "Regression and Other Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/).
 - Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking, 2nd ed](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book is easier than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking doesn't go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming as BDA course. Richard's lecture videos of [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) are highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.
 - For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4 and 5 in [Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/) useful.

## Communication channels

- The primary communication channel is the course slack. The slack link has been emailed to the accepted students.
    - Don't ask via email or direct messages. By asking via common channels in the course chat, more eyes will see your question, it will get answered faster and it's likely that other students benefit from the answer.
    - In the chat system, there are separate channels for each assignment and the project.
    - Channel **#general** can be used for any kind of general discussions and questions related to the course.
    - All important announcements will be posted to **#announcements** (no discussion on this channel).
    - Any kind of feedback is welcome on channel **#feedback**.
    - We have also channels **#r**, **#python**, and **#stan** for questions that are not specific to assignments or the project.
    - The lecturer and teaching assistants have names with "(staff)" or "(TA)" in the end of their names.
- In this course instance, most TAs are volunteers from different time zones, but there may be possibility for live "TA sessions" with TAs depending on the volunteers
- If you find errors in material, post in **#feedback** channel or [submit an issue in github](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/issues).
- Peergrade alerts: If you are worried that you forget the deadlines, you can set peergade to send you email when assignment opens for submission, 24 hours before assignment close for submission, assignment is open for reviewing, 24 hours before an assignment closes for reviewing if you haven't started yet, someone likes my feedback (once a day). Click your name -> User Settings to choose which alerts you want.

## Assessment

[Assignments](assignments_gsu.html) (67\%) and a [project work with
presentation](project_gsu.html) (33\%). Minimum of 50\% of points must
be obtained from both the assignments and project work. But as in this
course there is no formal certificate, the assignment scores are just
for your own self-evaluation. The biggest benefit from the course is
the support and feedback from other students and volunteer TAs.

We use [peergrade.io](https://peergrade.io/) for providing peer feedback for
the assignments and the project work. See more information at
[Assignments](assignments_gsu.html).

## Schedule 2022

The course consists of 12 blocks from February to May 2022. The blocks don't match exactly specific weeks. For example, it's good start reading the material for the next block while making the assignment for one block. There are 9 assignments and a project work with presentation, and thus the assignments are not in one-to-one correspondence with the blocks. The schedule below lists the blocks and how they connect to the topics, book chapters and assignments.

### Schedule overview - TODO: Update the dates

Here is an overview of the schedule. Scroll down the page to see detailed instructions for each block. Remember that blocks are overlapping so that when you are working on assignment for one block, you should start watching videos and reading text for the next block.

## R and Python

We strongly recommend using R in the course as there are more packages for Stan and statistical analysis in R. If you are already fluent in Python, but not in R, then using Python may be easier, but it can still be more useful to learn also R. Unless you are already experienced and have figured out your preferred way to work with R, we recommend

- installing [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/),

See [FAQ](FAQ.html) for frequently asked questions about R problems in this course. The [demo codes](demos.html) provide useful starting points for all the assignments.
