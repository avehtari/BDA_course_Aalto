The 2024 course web pages have been updated. If you notice something
that looks as old information from year 2023, please send a message in
Zulip. A big change in the course is the reduced use of peergrading as
the previously used system was shut down, which means also substantial
changes in the assignments. Old assignments are now stored in [assignments2023 folder](assignments2023/).

**Aalto 2024** course can be taken online except for the final project
presentation. The lectures will be given on campus, but recorded and the
recording will be made available online after the lecture. If you are
unable to register for the course at the moment in the Sisu, there is no
need to email the lecturer. You can start taking the course and register
before the end of the course. Sisu shows rooms on campus for the
computer exercises, and you can come to ask questions on campus, but
you can also ask in Zulip during the same times. You can choose which
TA session to join each week separately, without a need to register
for those sessions.

- [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=40722) is
  used for initial announcements, linking to Zulip, assignment
  quizzes, peergrading, and some questionnaires.
-   Most of the communication happens in the course chat (see below)
-   [Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations
    Thereof](https://www.aalto.fi/en/applications-instructions-and-guidelines/aalto-university-code-of-academic-integrity-and-handling-violations-thereof)
-   Use of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to be made by the student, and you need to report
    whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See [points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching](https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/guidance-for-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-teaching-and-learning-at-aalto-university)). We have tested some AI on the course topics and assignments and the output can be copy of existing text without attribution (ie plagiarism), vague or have mistakes, so you need to be careful when using such outputs.

All the course material is available in a [git
repo](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto) (and these pages are
for easier navigation). All the material can be used in other courses.

The material will be updated during the course. Exercise instructions
and slides will be updated at latest on Monday of the corresponding
week. The updated material will appear on the web pages, or you can
clone the repo and pull before checking new material. If you don't want
to learn git, you can download the latest [zip

![](bda_cover.png)
:::

[The electronic version of the course book Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd
ed, by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari,
and Donald Rubin](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) is available for
non-commercial purposes. Hard copies are available from [the
publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Bayesian-Data-Analysis/Gelman-Carlin-Stern-Dunson-Vehtari-Rubin/p/book/9781439840955)
and many book stores. Aalto library has also copies. See also [home page
for the book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), [errata for
the book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/errata_bda3.txt),
and [chapter notes](BDA3_notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   Basic terms of probability theory
    -   probability, probability density, distribution
    -   sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule
    -   expectation, mean, variance, median
    -   in Finnish, see e.g. [Stokastiikka ja tilastollinen
        ajattelu](http://math.aalto.fi/~lleskela/LectureNotes003.html)
    -   in English, see e.g. Wikipedia and [Introduction to probability
        and
        statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/)
-   Some algebra and calculus
-   Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
    -   histogram, density plot, scatter plot
    -   see e.g. [BDA R demos](demos.html#BDA_R_demos)
    -   see e.g. [BDA Python demos](demos.html#BDA_Python_demos)

This course has been designed so that there is strong emphasis in
computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest
computational tools. The project brings together the overall Bayesian
workflow aspects.

If you find BDA3 too difficult to start with, I recommend

-   For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and
    causal analysis see [Gelman, Hill and Vehtari: "Regression and Other
    Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/).
-   [Richard McElreath: Statistical Rethinking, 2nd
    ed](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book is easier
    than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking
    doesn't go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming
    as BDA course. Richard's lecture videos of [Statistical Rethinking:
    A Bayesian Course Using R and
    Stan](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) are
    highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.
-   [Johnson, Ott, and Dogucu: Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied
    Bayesian Modeling](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/)
-   For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4
    and 5 in [Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data
    Analysis"](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/)
    useful.

## Communication channels

-   [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=40722) is
    used for some intial announcements, linking to Zulip and Peergrade,
    and some questionnaires.
-   The primary communication channel is the Zulip course chat (link in
    MyCourses, login with Aalto account)
    -   Don't ask via email or direct messages. By asking via common
        streams in the course chat, more eyes will see your question, it
        will get answered faster and it's likely that other students
        benefit from the answer.
    -   Login with Aalto account to the Zulip course chat. You can adjust the notifications in the settings.
    -   If you have any questions, please ask in the public streams and
        get answers from course staff or other students (active students
        helping others will get bonus points).
    -   In the chat system, we will have separate streams for each
        assignment and the project.
    -   Stream **#general** can be used for any kind of general
        discussions and questions related to the course.
    -   All important announcements will be posted to **#announcements**
        (no discussion on this stream).
    -   Any kind of feedback is welcome on stream **#feedback**.
    -   We have also streams **#r**, **#python**, and **#stan** for
        questions that are not specific to assignments or the project.
    -   Stream **#queue** is used as a queue for getting help during [TA
        sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions).
    -   The lecturer and teaching assistants have names with "(staff)"
        or "(TA)" in the end of their names.
-   A weekly lecture time on campus includes times for questions and
    answers
-   If you need one-to-one help, please take part in the [TA
    sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions) and ask there.
-   If you find errors in material, post in **#feedback** stream or
    [submit an issue in
    github](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/issues).

## Assessment

[Assignments](assignments.html) (40%), e-exam (10%), and a [project
work with presentation](project.html) (50%). Minimum of 50% of points
must be obtained from each. You can get [bonus
points](assignments.html#bonus) from chat activity (e.g. helping other
students and reporting typos in the material) and answering time usage
questionnaries.

## Schedule 2024

The course consists of 12 lectures, 9 assignments, a project work, and
a project presentation in periods I and II. It's good start reading
the material for the next lecture and assignment while making the
assignment related to the previous lecture.  There are 9 assignments
and a project work with presentation, and thus the assignments are not
in one-to-one correspondence with the lectures.  The schedule below
lists the lectures and how they connect to the topics, book chapters
and assignments.

### Schedule overview

Here is an overview of the schedule. Scroll down the page to see
detailed instructions for each block. When you are working on
assignment related to previous lecture, it is good to start reading
the book chapters relaed to the next lecture and assignment.
The schedule links to 2023 lecture videos until couple hours after the
2024 lecture has been recorded.

## R

R is used in the course as there are more packages
for Stan and statistical analysis. Unless you are already experienced and
have figured out your preferred way to work with R, we recommend

-   [use RStudio in JupyterHub](FAQ.html#How_to_use_R_and_RStudio_remotely)
-   [or install RStudio Desktop locally](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/),

See [FAQ](FAQ.html) for frequently asked questions about R problems in
this course. The [demo codes](demos.html) provide useful starting points
for all the assignments.

Sanasta "bayesilainen" esiintyy Suomessa muutamaa erilaista
kirjoitustapaa. Olen käyttänyt muotoa "bayesilainen", joka on muodostettu yleisen
vieraskielisten nimien taivutussääntöjen mukaan: *"Jos nimi on
kirjoitettuna takavokaalinen mutta äännettynä etuvokaalinen,
kirjoitetaan päätteseen tavallisesti takavokaali etuvokaalin sijasta,
esim. Birminghamissa, Thamesilla." Terho Itkonen, Kieliopas, 6. painos,
Kirjayhtymä, 1997.*

Suomen tilastoseura sen sijaan suosittaa muotoa "bayseiläinen". Heidän
perustelunsa löytyy Tilastotieteen sanastosta (ks. linkki
yllä). Tilastotieteen sanaston verkkoversiossa on hakutoiminto, ja
PDF-versio sisältää käännösten perusteluita sekä hieman tilastotieteen
varhaista historiaa Suomessa.
