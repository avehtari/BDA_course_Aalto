**Aalto 2020** course will be completely online.

 - [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/user/index.php?id=28239) is used for important announcements and some questionnaires.
 - Most of the communication happens in the course chat (see below)

All the course material is available in a [git repo](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto) (and these pages are for easier navigation). All the material can be used in other courses. Text and videos licensed under CC-BY-NC 4.0. Code licensed under BSD-3.

The material will be updated during the course. Exercise instructions and slides will be updated at latest on Monday of the corresponding week. The updated material will appear on web pages, or you can clone the repo and pull before checking new material. If you don't want to learn git, you can download the latest [zip file](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/archive/master.zip).

[The electronic version of the course book
Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd ed, by by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal
Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) is available for non-commercial purposes. Hard copies are available from [the publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Bayesian-Data-Analysis/Gelman-Carlin-Stern-Dunson-Vehtari-Rubin/p/book/9781439840955) and many book stores. Aalto library has also copies.
See also [home page for the
book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), [errata for the
book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/errata_bda3.txt), and [chapter notes](chapter_notes/BDA_notes.pdf).

## Prerequisites

 - Basic terms of probability theory
     - probability, probability density, distribution
     - sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule
     - expectation, mean, variance, median
     - in Finnish, see e.g. [Stokastiikka ja tilastollinen ajattelu](http://math.aalto.fi/~lleskela/LectureNotes003.html)
     - in English, see e.g. Wikipedia and [Introduction to probability and statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/)
 - Some algebra and calculus
 - Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
     - histogram, density plot, scatter plot
     - see e.g. [BDA R demos](demos.html#BDA_R_demos)
     - see e.g. [BDA Python demos](demos.html#BDA_Python_demos)

This course has been designed so that there is strong emphasis in
computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest
computational tools.

If you find BDA3 too difficult to start with, I recommend

 - For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and causal analysis see [Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, "Regression and Other Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/).
 - Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking, 2nd ed](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book is easier than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking doesn't go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming as BDA course. Richard's lecture videos of [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) are highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.
 - For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4 and 5 in [Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/) useful.

## Communication channels

- [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/user/index.php?id=28239) is used for important announcements and some questionnaires.
- The primary communication channel is the course chat.
    - Don't ask via email or direct messages. By asking via common channels in the course chat, more eyes will see your question, it will get answered faster and it's likely that other students benefit from the answer.
    - Login with Aalto account to [the course chat](https://cs-e5710-2020.chat.aalto.fi/) (it looks like Microsoft Teams login, but just use your Aalto account and it works)
    - If you have any questions, please ask in the public channels and get answers from course staff or other students (active students helping others will get bonus points) 
    - In the chat system, we will have separate channels for each assignment and the project.
    - Channel **#general** can be used for any kind of general discussions and questions related to the course.
    - All important announcements will be posted to **#announcements** (no discussion on this channel).
    - Any kind of feedback is welcome on channel **#feedback**.
    - We have also channels **#r**, **#python**, and **#stan** for questions that are not specific to assignments or the project.
    - Channel **#queue** is used as a queue for getting help during [TA sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions).
    - The lecturer and teaching assistants have names with "(staff)" or "(TA)" in the end of their names.
- A weekly Q&A session with the lecturer happens in Zoom webinar (see times below)
    - Q&A session assumes you have self studied at least some of the material before the session
    - Q&A session will remind about the important announcements
    - Zoom webinar polls, Q&A feature, chat, and audio talking will be used for interaction
    - Zoom webinar polls don't show up in browser zoom client! If you want to see the polls and the poll results, install a desktop client.
    - The form of the Q&A session will develop based on the feedback from the students
    - Q&A session is not recorded, but the answers to most relevant questions will be shared or short additional videos will be recorded
- If you need one-to-one help, please take part in the [TA sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions) and ask there.
- If you find errors in material, post in **#feedback** channel or [submit an issue in github](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/issues).
- Peergrade alerts: If you are worried that you forget the deadlines, you can set peergade to send you email when assignment opens for submission, 24 hours before assignment close for submission, assignment is open for reviewing, 24 hours before an assignment closes for reviewing if you haven't started yet, someone likes my feedback (once a day). Click your name -> User Settings to choose which alerts you want.

## Assessment

[Assignments](assignments.html) (67\%) and a [project work with
presentation](project.html) (33\%). Minimum of 50\% of points must be
obtained from both the assignments and project work.

## Schedule 2020

The course consists of 12 blocks in periods I and II. The blocks don't match exactly specific weeks. For example, it's good start reading the material for the next block while making the assignment for one block. There are 9 assignments and a project work with presentation, and thus the assignments are not in one-to-one correspondence with the blocks. The schedule below lists the blocks and how they connect to the topics, book chapters and assignments.

Currently the video links are for the videos recorded 2019. Part of the videos will be re-recorded.

### Schedule overview

Here is an overview of the schedule. Scroll down the page to see detailed instructions for each block. Remember that blocks are overlapping so that when you are working on assignment for one block, you should start watching videos and reading text for the next block.

## R and Python

We strongly recommend using R in the course as there are more packages for Stan and statistical analysis in R. If you are already fluent in Python, but not in R, then using Python may be easier, but it can still be more useful to learn also R. Unless you are already experienced and have figured out your preferred way to work with R, we recommend

- installing [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/),
- [or use RStudio remotely](FAQ.html#How_to_use_R_and_RStudio_remotely)

See [FAQ](FAQ.html) for frequently asked questions about R problems in this course. The [demo codes](demos.html) provide useful starting points for all the assignments.
