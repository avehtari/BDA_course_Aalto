# Bayesian Data Analysis course exercises

Exercises and evaluation criteria are in [exercises
folder](exercises). Exercises are submitted in
[peergrade](https://www.peergrade.io).

(Please free to use these exercises in self study and other courses,
but please do not publish complete answers online).

## Exercise sessions

One can get personal help in in weekly exercise sessions. The sessions
are voluntary and one may come and go as pleases during the
sessions. Queuing system may be used if there will be too many
students in some hours.

## Weekly assignment details

There are 9 weekly exercises (assignments in peergrade). Students
return their answers to [peergrade](https://www.peergrade.io) by the
end of the week (hand-in period). The exercises are introduced on
Mondays. The deadlines are Sunday 23:59 (the dates are given in the
table below).  After this, each student grades 3 random other
students' answers with detailed online form in peergrade during Monday
to Wednesday (peer grading period). After peergrading, each student to
should provide reactions to the feedback (e.g. not
helpful/helpful). If a student receives inappropriate grading or
reaction, they may "flag" it for TAs to check from Wednesday to Sunday
(flagging period). Strongly conflicting gradings are also manually
checked by TAs (after flagging period).

Assignments can be found from [exercises folder](exercises)

NOTE: The assignments instructions on github are still being updated
and individual exercises are not guaranteed to be up to date until
Monday (4am) of the hand-in period of the corresponding exercise week
(See the deadlines below, e.g. first exercise is not guaranteed to be
up to date until 9.9 at 8am).

Report all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in
[peergrade](https://www.peergrade.io). Include also any source code to
the report (either in appendix or embedded in the answer). By
anonymity it is meant that the report should not contain your name or
student number. In addition to the correctness of the answers, the
overall quality and clearness of the report is also evaluated.

The exercises are mostly solved using computer (R or Python). Related
demos for each exercise are available in GitHub (links in Materials
section). Exercise help sessions are organised on Wednesdays 14:15-16,
Thursdays 12:15-14 and Fridays 10:15-12 (check the room of the day
from Oodi). We will have an additional slot in the first week on
Wednesday 11.9 from 12:15-14. The location may change from week to
week, hence it is recommended to check the time and location every
week from Oodi.

 The sessions are very informal, a bit similar to service teaching
 (laskutupa) of the basic math courses. No need to register, feel free
 to come and ask TAs or join forces with some friends (each student
 must answer individually though). Participating to the exercise
 sessions is not required for passing the course. If one can solve all
 exercises without any help, it is totally OK to skip the exercise
 sessions. On the other hand, if some exercise feels hard, it is
 totally OK to attend all exercise sessions! It is also OK to attend
 the exercise sessions only for a while.

For those who are self studying or who miss several assignment
hand-ins for a good reason, there is possibility to hand-in all
assignments once in January.

## Assignment scoring

Points are given from both submitting an assignment and giving
feedback. Submission performance gives 70 % and feedback performance
gives 30 % of the total score. Only the student's who returned
assignment are allowed to give feedback to others.

In peergrade, the resulting grade is formed by comparing one's
performance to the others. Thus, one should not worry about getting
100 % score. A critical reviewer will also affect other students'
grading. In addition, a question can always be flagged for course
personnel to check.

In addition to the peergrade score, one can get some bonus points from
slack activity. Slack activity will not count for maximum assignment
score. Other students' Slack activity will not affect one's resulting
grade, i.e. there is no need to try to perform in the Slack or to take
any part in it at all.

We have noticed in previous years that some students return an empty
pdf to peergrade to still get points from giving feedback. This is not
allowed. If a student returns an empty pdf or it is obvious from the
pdf that the student hasn't done any effort for the assignment, the
student is not allowed to give feedback. The course staff will monitor
returned assignments, and negative points will be awarded to empty assignments.
If any student is reviewing an empty pdf, please contact course staff.

## Submission score

Within each assignment, there are two sections "Basic requirements"
and "Overall quality of the report". Each of these always gives 7.5 %
of that assignment's total score. The remaining 85 % is distributed
evenly to the rest of the sections. Within each section, the points
are distributed evenly among each question. In each question, the
points are linearly scaled (yes/no: 1 / 0, three options: 1 / 0.5 / 0,
four options: 1 / 0.666 / 0.333 / 0, etc).

Each question score is averaged from all the received feedback. If a
flag is raised and course personnel grades the question, it will
override all the received feedback scores.

There are 9 assignment rounds in total. The deadlines for the
assignments are given below.

## Feedback score

More info on the feedback score can be found
[here](https://help.peergrade.io/en/articles/111176-how-the-feedback-score-is-calculated). Note
that the feedback score system has been simplified from previous
years.

## Be polite

Remember to be polite when giving feedback and reacting to
feedback. Do not spend long time to fight for grading of one question
from one student. If you don't agree you can flag or in extreme case
contact TAs, but do also remember than in most of the cases, which
we've seen, the students have been fighting for points which have less
than 1/1000 effect on the final score. Long fight for that is not
worth it.  If you get feedback which make you angry, breath and wait a
moment before unleashing your anger back. We ask you to honor the
system and be polite to your peers.

## Project work details

Project work is done in groups of 1-3 persons. Preferred group size is
2. Groups of 1-2 persons are assumed to do same amount of work per
group. Group of 3 persons is assumed to do 50% more work.

The groups will get help for the project work at the exercise help
sessions. When there are no weekly assignments, the exercise sessions
are still organized for helping in the project work.
